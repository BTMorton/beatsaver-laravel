## Beatsaver 

- Beatsaver is a custom song platform for Beatsaber (http://beatsaber.com/)
- In order to use custom song see [BeatSaberModInstaller](https://github.com/Umbranoxio/BeatSaberModInstaller/releases)

## Roadmap

- layout overhaul
- song tagging
- song rating depending on difficulties included (highlight songs with more than just expert/+ difficulty) 
- download queues (select songs via website and have the ingame downloader load them on next start)
- scoresaber.com integration for uploaded songs (or more) 
- ability to link preview videos for songs

<p><b>Please note:</b></p>
Items on the roadmap are ideas I came across while using the original beatsaver. 
They may or may not be worth implementing. Some items depend on other mod authors to incorporate
features into their mods in order for the feature to work.
